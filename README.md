# Selenium-LInkedIn-WebCrawler

Hello!

This is a webcrawler I wrote in using selenium python utilizing the unittest framework. It logs into linkedin and collects data on jobs and parses them into a json file.

I use this data in another project where I create a linkedIn clone with the parsed data using React. You can see that project in my portfolio if you want.

I did this as a way to learn python and get better at selenium for work, and also teach myself React in the other project.

To run this project simply add your username and password into the main file and run it.

Enjoy!
